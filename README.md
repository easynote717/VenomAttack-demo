## VenomAttackVideoDemo folder
The *VenomAttackVideoDemo* folder is the actual operation records of two *Phishing attack* demos, *Spoofing attack* demo and *Denial of service attack* demo from userâ€™s perspective.  
Due to the size limitation of the uploaded file, we divided the video file into multiple compressed packages for uploading.  

## VideoDemoGaussianBlur folder
Because of the testing of the app, we had to perform Gaussian blurring on some images that would reveal our personal information.  
These processing will not affect the video playback effect.  
Except for these processes, the contents of *VideoDemoGaussianBlur* folder are exactly the same as those of *VenomAttackVideoDemo*.  
So in the blind review stage, please download the video in the *VideoDemoGaussianBlur* folder to watch.  
Or, we published a web page for online viewing, which is more convenient for you.
